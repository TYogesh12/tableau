## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project analyzes heart disease data using Tableau to identify major risk factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, and physical activity.

The objective is to transform raw healthcare data into meaningful visual insights that help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and individuals make informed decisions.
